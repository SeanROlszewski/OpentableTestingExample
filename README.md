# Repository Overview
 The purpose of this repository is to facilitate a live coding workshop. The objective of the workshop is to improve an attendee's understanding of automated testing. To facilitate this, this repository includes a starter app with a set of features to be implemented. Each of these features should have an automated test to prove its correctness and completeness. Each feature was selected because it serves as a good example of a common testing problem.
